# Sample Document

This is a sample document to test the document ingestion process.

## Features

- Automatic embedding generation
- OpenSearch integration
- Vector search capabilities
  
## How it works

When this document is uploaded to the API, a Lambda function will:
1. Extract the text content
2. Generate embeddings using Amazon Bedrock's Titan model
3. Store the document and its embedding in OpenSearch

This enables semantic search capabilities!
